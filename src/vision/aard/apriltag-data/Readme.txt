Rotation: None (Identity Matrix)

rgb2 - partial view of tag
Translation [55.8cm, 25cm, 0]
rotation: none

rgb3 - Camera is pointed down at the tag
Translation [55.8cm, 25cm, 0]
rotation: (maybe only in one axis)

rgb4 - Camera is to the left of the tag. Numbers on this one are more eyeballed

rotation: identity

rgb4 can also be used for the tag36h11 and tag15h5 families
The camera is to the right of those tags
Translation: [134cm ,50cm, height: some neg some positive]
